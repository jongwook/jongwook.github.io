I have just set up a new blog with [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), and made a slightly modified version of [hexo-tag-katex](https://github.com/jongwook/hexo-tag-katex) to compile LaTeX expressions inside dollar signs, instead of using Hexo tags. [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) is a wonderful library built by [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), which renders LaTeX equations a lot faster and more beautifully than MathJax.

\[
H(T) | \psi(t) > = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} | \psi(t) >
\]

I like this hackability and the native integration with the browsers of Hexo, and in part that I am less familiar with Ruby. I am going to make this my personal website, migrating from Tumbler which started to put a video ad on their page.
