I am pursuing a PhD in Music Technology at New York University since 2011. Under Dr. Juan Pablo Bello’s supervision, I worked on projects that apply numerous machine learning techniques to statistically analyze music signals and deduce its musical properties like tempo, genre, melody, harmony etc. During the study I took a leave of absence between the summers of 2012 and 2015 for the military service in South Korea.

For the latter half of those three years I worked at Kakao Corp., designing and developing recommender systems which provide personalized recommendations for the company’s hundreds of millions of users. To achieve this I utilized a number of (so-called) big data solutions including Hadoop, Hive, HBase and Spark. Before that, I worked at NCSOFT and developed a distributed MMORPG game platform for a title called Lineage Eternal, using techniques like consistent hashing, in-memory data grids, functional reactive programming, etc.

I received a Master of Science degree in computer science from Rackham Graduate School, University of Michigan. Focusing on intelligent systems, Ann Arbor was a great place to boost my knowledge on computer science, as well as to familiarize myself to the lifestyle and culture of western society. With Dr. Georg Essl, I participated in smartphone orchestras and developed a mobile interactive music app called urMus.

Located in Daejeon, South Korea, KAIST was a great place for me to do my undergraduate studies. I majored in electrical engineering and minored in mathematics, so upon graduating I was able to fully understand the linkage ranging from the physics of the nature all the way up to the computers, where it connected the theory of electromagnetism, electronic circuits, computer architecture and software engineering.

I was fortunate enough to attend Korea Science Academy, a high school for science-focused students where I met the greatest and smartest friends and teachers. KSA was the place where I realized that I love science and decided to pursue my career path in that direction.

I have been playing the oboe for about 10 years now, the repertoire including Beethoven’s symphonies 2, 3, 5, 8 and 9, Tchaikovsky’s symphonies 4 and 5, among many others. Filling my melody in the harmony of the entire orchestra, the woodwind instrument makes me feel happy and confident and the feeling makes me love music. While in New York I shortly played the keyboard in a band, and played the piano accompanying a praise team in Korean Presbyterian Church of Ann Arbor.

I like traveling around countries and I have been to the US, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong and numerous European countries, yet I like to travel and explore more and meet people around the world.
