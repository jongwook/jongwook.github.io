Please find a [Résumé](resume-jongwook-kim.pdf) of mine.

I am a member of technical staff at OpenAI since Auguest 2019, where I focus on developing large-scale deep learning models that encompass multiple modalities. While at OpenAI, I participated in a number of projects including [GPT-2 output detection](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset/tree/master/detector), [Jukebox](https://openai.com/blog/jukebox), [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/), and [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper).

I completed a PhD in Music Technology at New York University. With Dr. Juan Pablo Bello’s supervision, I worked on projects that apply numerous machine learning techniques to statistically analyze music signals and deduce its musical properties like tempo, genre, melody, harmony etc. I did two internships focusing on music recommendation and synthesis, at Pandora in 2017 and at Spotify in 2018. Prior to that, I took a leave of absence between 2012 and 2015 to work in South Korea.

For the latter half of those years I worked at Kakao Corp., designing and developing recommender systems which provide personalized recommendations for the company’s hundreds of millions of users. To achieve this I utilized a number of big-data solutions including Hadoop, Hive, HBase and Spark. Before that, I worked at NCSOFT and developed a distributed MMORPG game platform for a title called Lineage Eternal, using techniques like consistent hashing, in-memory data grids, functional reactive programming, etc.

I received a Master of Science degree in computer science from Rackham Graduate School, University of Michigan. Focusing on intelligent systems, Ann Arbor was a great place to boost my knowledge on computer science, as well as to familiarize myself to the lifestyle and culture of the Western society. With Dr. Georg Essl, I participated in smartphone orchestras and developed a mobile interactive music app called urMus.

Located in Daejeon, South Korea, KAIST was a great place for me to do my undergraduate studies. I majored in electrical engineering and minored in mathematics, so upon graduating I was able to grasp the linkage ranging from the physics of the nature all the way up to the computers, where it connected the theory of electromagnetism, electronic circuits, computer architecture and software engineering.

I was fortunate enough to attend Korea Science Academy, a high school for science-focused students where I met the greatest and smartest friends and teachers. KSA was the place where I realized that I love science and technology and decided to pursue my career path in that direction.

I have been playing the oboe for about 15 years now, the repertoire including Beethoven’s symphonies 2, 3, 5, 8 and 9, Tchaikovsky’s symphonies 4 and 5, among many others. Filling my melody in the harmony of the entire orchestra, the woodwind instrument makes me feel happy and confident and the feeling makes me love music. While in New York I shortly played the keyboard in a band, and played the piano accompanying a praise team in Korean Presbyterian Church of Ann Arbor.

I'm happily married with my wife [Na Young](https://nayoungjun.github.io/) since 2017, and we adore our cat April. I like traveling around countries and I have been to the US, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong, and many European and South American countries, yet I like to travel and explore more and meet people around the world.
