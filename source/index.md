Iâ€™m a PhD Candidate studying music technology at New York University. I focus in music informatics and machine learning, looking for solutions to automatic transcription, source separation, timbre modeling, etc. In the past, I was a software engineer/data scientist at Kakao Corp and NCSOFT Corp developing recommender systems and application servers.
